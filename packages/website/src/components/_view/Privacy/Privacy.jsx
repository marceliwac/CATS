      applicable law to process your information without your consent,
      including, for example:

          If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent
          cannot be obtained in a timely way
        </li>
        <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>

        </li>
        <li>
          If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
          compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the
          collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
          breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a
          province
        </li>

      <h2>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
      We may need to share your personal information in the following
      situations: Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information
      in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company
      assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to
      another company.
      <h2>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
      for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
      legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping
      your personal information for longer than the period of time in which
      users have an account with us. When we have no ongoing legitimate business
      need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
      anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example,
      because your personal information has been stored in backup archives),
      then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
      any further processing until deletion is possible.
      <h2>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
      We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
      organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any
      personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
      efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
      Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
      secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
      other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security
      and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
      Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
      transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your
      own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
      <h2>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
      In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights
      under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to
      request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to
      request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your
      personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In
      certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
      processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by
      contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section
      &apos;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&apos; below. We will

      withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact
      details provided in the section &apos;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS
      NOTICE?&apos; below. However, please note that this will not affect the
      lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable
      law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information
      conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

      applications include a Do-Not-Track (&apos;DNT&apos;) feature or setting
      you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
      your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
      uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
      signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
      not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
      in a revised version of this privacy notice.
